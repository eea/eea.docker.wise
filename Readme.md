# Docker Orchestration for WISE Portal

## Installation

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/centos/).

2. Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

3. Install [Rancher CLI](http://www.rancher.com)

## Usage

### Development

In order to be able to edit source-code on your machine using your favorite editor, without having to do it inside a Docker container, you'll have to create a new user on your laptop with `uid=500` and use this user for development:

    $ useradd -u 500 zope-www
    $ usermod -a -G docker zope-www
    $ sudo su - zope-www

Now get the source code:

    $ git clone https://github.com/eea/eea.docker.wise.git
    $ cd eea.docker.wise/wise-devel
    $ docker-compose -f source-code.yml up

Start the Plone container:

    $ docker-compose up -d

Then connect with bash to the Plone container:

    $ docker exec -it wisedevel_plone_1 bash

Inside the container start the Plone instance in foreground:

    $ bin/instance fg

Within your favorite browser head to http://localhost:8080,
add a Plone site and install the following add-ons:
* `EEA Plone buildout profile`
* `wise.theme`
* `wise.content`

Now you are ready to develop Plone Add-ons within `src` folder:

    $ ls -l src/

You can do normal Plone development, including setting breakpoints
with pdb. The eggs used in the buildout are in the parent folder of
the default location. If you need to debug something, to set a
breakpoint, you can use vi to edit files.

### Deployment

#### Pre-requirements:

* [Rancher CLI](https://docs.rancher.com/rancher/v1.2/en/cli/)
* Within Rancher UI register min 1 hosts with label: `wise=yes`

On your laptop:

    $ git clone https://github.com/eea/eea.docker.wise.git
    $ cd eea.docker.wise

#### Access rights

To enable Rancher CLI to launch services in a Rancher instance, youâ€™ll need to configure it
See related [Rancher documentation](http://docs.rancher.com/rancher/v1.3/en/api/v2-beta/access-control/)
on how to obtain your Rancher API Keys. Thus:

1. Via Rancher UI:

    * Go to **API Tab** add an **Account API Key**

2. On your laptop configure Rancher CLI:

        $ rancher config

3. Make sure that you're deploying within the right environment:

        $ rancher config -p

#### Deploy in production:

    $ rancher up -d

#### Upgrade:

    $ rancher up -d --upgrade --batch-size 1

...and confirm that the upgrade went well:

    $ rancher up -d --confirm-upgrade

...or roll-back:

    $ rancher up -d --roll-back
